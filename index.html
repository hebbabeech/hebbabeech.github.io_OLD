<h2><center>Childminding Service available in Staffordshire</center></h2>
<p><center>Contact me at <a href="beechtree.childcare">beechtreechildcare@gmail.co.uk </a> or on 01234 567890</center></p>
<p>Hello, I am a childminder with over a decade of experience childminding, and <em>two decades</em> experience of motherhood! I take care of babies under 1 year old and children up to the age of 4 years.</p>
<p>I am happy to drop off and collect your children from the local schools, and I will provide your child with three meals a day (dependent on their hours) as well as snacks.</p>
<h3>A bit About me and my Family</h3>
<p>I was born and grew up in Lombok, Indonesia where I worked in the tourism and catering industry. Around 25 years ago I moved to London and then moved to Stoke-on-Trent, where my husband grew up, around 18 years ago. When my children were younger, I worked in various jobs:
<ul>
<li>Nursery assistant</li>
<li>Dinner Lady </li>
</ul>
My service is provided at my home. Whilst at my house your children will probably meet my husband and two daughters. My family have been CRB checked and will treat your children like family.
<h3>Education and Child Development</h3>
Under government regulations, during their time at Beech Tree Childcare I will document your child progressing with developmental skills and learning and trying new things. I encourage the children to try new foods and play together. I have many toys, both indoor and outdoor, to encourage imaginative play. We often do painting, drawing and writing to advance fine motor skills. At any age, I have techniques that will help your child to develop important skills through play. I will also help with potty training, learning to talk and walk.
<h3>Activities Away From my Setting</h3>
As well as home-based activities, I also have close links will local libraries and children centres. Every week we visit Kiddy Zumba, Singalong Hour, play groups, the wacky warehouse, the park and more! Additionally, I am notified of any special events happening such as animal workshops, music workshops and seasonal actvities such as Santa's Grotto!
<h3>To Secure a Place at Beech Tree Childcare</h3>
I only take care of up to 5 children at any time, in order to provide your children with the best care. Unlike a nursery, Beech Tree Childcare is about personalised care for your child and therefore I do not take on a large group. My services are often in demand and so it's best to contact me and I will arrange a meeting to discuss more about how I work and so that I can meet you and the child, and you and your child can meet me, possibly some of the other children I look after, and see my setting. Cost of my childcare will be discussed at a meeting and will depend on the hours that you require.
